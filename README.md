Z-index, width, height, last modification date, and a unique identifier.
</br>X, Y, and Z-index are
integers (may be negative).
</br> Width and height are integers > 0.
</br>Widget attributes should be not null.
</br>A Z-index is a unique sequence common to all widgets that
determines the order of widgets (regardless of their coordinates).
Gaps are allowed. The higher the value, the higher the widget
lies on the plane.
